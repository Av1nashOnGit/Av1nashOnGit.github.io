Caching is an essential aspect of modern applications, particularly to enhance performance and reduce latency by avoiding redundant computations or database calls. It plays a pivotal role in scenarios like reducing API call latency, decreasing database query overhead, and improving the overall user experience by speeding up data retrieval processes. When designed properly, caching can help applications scale efficiently while maintaining high responsiveness. This document provides a comprehensive guide to caching in Spring Boot, along with practical implementations and best practices.

## **3. Monitoring Cache with Spring Boot Actuator**
Spring Boot Actuator provides robust capabilities for monitoring cache usage, enabling developers to track key metrics and optimize cache performance. Here is how to set up and access these Actuator endpoints for cache in a Spring Boot project:
### Configuration Steps:
1. **Add the Actuator Dependency**
    Include the Actuator starter dependency in your `pom.xml`:
    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```
    
2. **Expose Endpoints in** `**application.yml**`:
    Enable the required Actuator endpoints by updating your `application.yml` configuration:
    ```
    management:
      endpoints:
        web:
          exposure:
            include: "metrics, caches"
      metrics:
        enable.cache: true
    ```

3. **Access Cache Metrics**:    
    Use the Actuator endpoint `/actuator/metrics/cache.*` to retrieve cache-related data, such as cache hits and misses.
### Example Actuator Output:
When you hit the cache metrics endpoint, you might see a response like this:
```
{
  "name": "cache.gets",
  "measurements": [
    { "statistic": "COUNT", "value": 15.0 }
  ],
  "availableTags": [
    { "tag": "result", "values": ["hit", "miss"] },
    { "tag": "cache", "values": ["zipCodeCacheData"] }
  ]
}
```
### Insights from the Metrics:
- **Hits**: The number of successful cache lookups.
- **Misses**: The number of times the requested data was not found in the cache and had to be fetched from the original source.

These metrics help in evaluating the effectiveness of the cache and identifying opportunities for optimization. Here is how you can enable and use it:

### Configuration:
1. Add the dependency:
    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

2. Enable cache metrics in `application.yml`:
    ```
    management:
      endpoints:
        web:
          exposure:
            include: "metrics"
      metrics:
        enable.cache: true
    ```
    
3. Access the cache metrics via `/actuator/metrics/cache.*` endpoint.
    

### Example Metrics:

```
{
  "name": "cache.gets",
  "measurements": [
    { "statistic": "COUNT", "value": 10.0 }
  ],
  "availableTags": [
    { "tag": "result", "values": ["hit", "miss"] }
  ]
}
```

### Understanding Hits and Misses:

- **Hits**: Number of times data is retrieved from the cache.
    
- **Misses**: Number of times data is not found in the cache and needs to be fetched from the source.

## **4. Common Questions and Scenarios**

### What Happens If an Exception is Thrown in a `@Cacheable` Method?

- If a method annotated with `@Cacheable` throws an exception, the cache is not updated.
    

### What Happens If `key` Is Not Provided in `@Cacheable`?

- Spring Boot generates a default key based on all method parameters.
    
    - Example: `@Cacheable("myCache")` without a `key` uses all parameters to create a key.
        

### Can We Use `@Cacheable` on Private Methods?

- No, Spring AOP does not work with private methods. Always use `@Cacheable` on public methods.

## **5. Distributed Caching with Hazelcast**

### Why Hazelcast?

- Distributed in-memory caching becomes essential in scenarios where horizontal scaling and fault tolerance are critical. It is particularly beneficial for applications with a microservices architecture or systems handling high-volume concurrent requests across multiple nodes. These systems require consistent data across the distributed cache to avoid bottlenecks and ensure reliability. Distributed caching frameworks like Hazelcast or Redis are well-suited for these use cases due to their multi-node support, fault tolerance, and scalability.
    
- Multi-node support ensures consistency and fault tolerance.
    

### Configuration:

1. Add dependency:
    
    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
        <artifactId>hazelcast-spring</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```
    
2. Configure Hazelcast in `application.yml`:
    
    ```
    spring:
      cache:
        type: hazelcast
    hazelcast:
      network:
        join:
          tcp-ip:
            enabled: true
            members:
              - 192.168.1.100
              - 192.168.1.101
          multicast:
            enabled: false
    ```
    
3. Create Hazelcast configuration bean:
    
    ```
    @Configuration
    public class HazelcastConfig {
    
        @Bean
        public Config hazelcastConfig() {
            Config config = new Config();
            config.setInstanceName("hazelcast-instance")
                  .getNetworkConfig()
                  .getJoin()
                  .getMulticastConfig()
                  .setEnabled(false);
            return config;
        }
    }
    ```

## **6. Code Example: Caffeine Cache Implementation**

### Configuration:

1. Add dependency:
    
    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.ben-manes.caffeine</groupId>
        <artifactId>caffeine</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```
    
2. Cache configuration:
    
    ```
    @Configuration
    public class CacheConfig {
    
        @Bean
        public CaffeineCacheManager cacheManager() {
            CaffeineCacheManager cacheManager = new CaffeineCacheManager("zipCodeCacheData");
            cacheManager.setCaffeine(Caffeine.newBuilder()
                .expireAfterWrite(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
                .maximumSize(100));
            return cacheManager;
        }
    }
    ```
    
3. Using `@Cacheable`:
    
    ```
    @Service
    public class ZipCodeService {
    
        @Cacheable("zipCodeCacheData")
        public String getZipCodeData(String zipCode) {
            // Simulate a time-consuming database call
            return fetchFromDatabase(zipCode);
        }
    
        private String fetchFromDatabase(String zipCode) {
            return "Data for ZipCode: " + zipCode;
        }
    }
    ```

## **7. Testing Cache Behavior**

### Write Unit Tests:

```
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class CacheTest {

    @Autowired
    private ZipCodeService zipCodeService;

    @Test
    public void testCacheable() {
        String zip1 = zipCodeService.getZipCodeData("12345");
        String zip2 = zipCodeService.getZipCodeData("12345");

        Assert.assertEquals(zip1, zip2);
    }
}
```
