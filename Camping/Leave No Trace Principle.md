The Leave No Trace (LNT) principles are a set of guidelines for outdoor ethics and sustainable outdoor practices. They are designed to minimize the impact of human activities on the environment and help preserve the natural beauty of outdoor spaces. The seven Leave No Trace principles are:

1. **Plan Ahead and Prepare**:
    
    - Thoroughly plan your trip, considering the environment, regulations, and the needs of your group.
    - Prepare for different weather conditions and emergencies.
2. **Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces**:
    
    - Stick to established trails and campsites to avoid damaging fragile ecosystems.
    - Use designated campsites and avoid creating new ones.
3. **Dispose of Waste Properly**:
    
    - Pack out all trash and litter, leaving no trace of your visit.
    - Dispose of human waste in a responsible manner using appropriate methods or facilities.
4. **Leave What You Find**:
    
    - Do not pick plants, disturb wildlife, or remove rocks, historical, or cultural artifacts.
    - Leave natural and cultural features as you found them.
5. **Minimize Campfire Impact**:
    
    - Use a camp stove for cooking instead of making a campfire, as fires can scar and damage the land.
    - If fires are allowed, use established fire rings and keep them small.
6. **Respect Wildlife**:
    
    - Observe animals from a distance and do not feed them.
    - Store food securely to avoid attracting wildlife to your campsite.
7. **Be Considerate of Other Visitors**:
    
    - Keep noise levels down and yield the trail to others.
    - Maintain a friendly and respectful attitude toward fellow outdoor enthusiasts.

These principles are essential for protecting and preserving natural areas, ensuring that they remain enjoyable for future generations. Following Leave No Trace practices helps promote responsible outdoor recreation and conservation.
