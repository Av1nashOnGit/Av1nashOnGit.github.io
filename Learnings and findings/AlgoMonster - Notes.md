Findings
- Insertion and Bubble both can be efficient for almost sorted data
- Java uses different sorting algorithms depending on the data being sorted. For primitive types, it uses "a Dual-Pivot Quicksort by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy, Jon Bentley, and Joshua Bloch.
- For objects, Java uses a version of the previously mentioned Timsort that allows faster sorting of the partially sorted array
Task
- Practice Insertion sort, Bubble Sort and Selection Sort
