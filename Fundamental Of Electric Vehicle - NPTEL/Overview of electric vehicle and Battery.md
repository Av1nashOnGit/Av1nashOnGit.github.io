While it can be seen that **EV's** are far better than **ICE** based vehicle, but there's a problem with the battery that we have currently, it store very little as compare to petrol in the same volume which has caused less adoption of Ev's word wide, however people are working on this and in future we'll definetely have solution for this.

As You can see in the image
- Watt-hour (**Wh**) : 1 watt of power for 1 hour
	- A 30 watt bulb used for 1 hour is 30 Wh of energy
	- Unit of energy used for electricity metering : **1kWh** which is 1000 watts used for 1 hour or 100 watts used for 10 hours
	- A small Indian home consumes about 2 units of electricity in a day ie **2kWh**

```
Personal Calculation :-
An avg Indian Home can use 30 unit/day, which means 30kWh ie 900kWh a month
ie  30,000 watt for 1  hour
or  3,000  watt for 10 hour
or  600    watt for 50 hour
or  1250   watt for 24 hour ie 1250 watt/hour
```

	Gravitation Energy Density - Watt-hour per kg
	Volumetric Energy Density - Watt-hour per litre (1000 cc)

##### Here's the list of materials and their approx energy density measured in kWh/kg

|Material|Energy Density (kWh/kg)|Energy Density (kWh/L)|Energy Efficiency Ratio (kWh/kg)|Energy Efficiency Ratio (kWh/L)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Petrol (Gasoline)|-|9.5|-|1.00|
|Diesel|-|10|-|1.05|
|Coal|8|-|0.70-1.02|-|
|Wood|5|-|0.47-0.61|-|
|CNG|15|-|1.52-1.63|-|
|Lithium-ion Battery|-|0.25-0.7|-|0.03-0.07|
|Lead-acid Battery|-|0.1-0.14|-|0.01-0.02|
|Hydrogen Fuel|33.36|-|3.51|-|
