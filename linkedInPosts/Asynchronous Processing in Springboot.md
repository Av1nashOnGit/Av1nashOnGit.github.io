@Async annotation can help to achieve this, to use this we need to use @EnableAsync annotation in main class of spring application

@Async annotation uses default executor to create and manage threads, if no default executor present it'll create new SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor.

We should always create custom ThreadPoolTaskExecutor to have more control of thread management in spring boot
```java
@Configuration
public class AsyncConfig {

    @Bean(name = "taskExecutor")
    public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(5);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(10);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(25);
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix("AsyncExecutor-");
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}

```




### Advanced Configuration of Asynchronous Processing in Spring Boot

Asynchronous processing is a pivotal technique in modern software systems, enabling non-blocking operations that improve application scalability and responsiveness. Spring Boot provides robust support for asynchronous programming through its `@Async` annotation and task executors, which can be customized for optimal performance. This section offers a comprehensive exploration of configuring and optimizing asynchronous processing.

---

### **1. Enabling Asynchronous Processing**

To leverage asynchronous capabilities in Spring Boot, follow these steps:

#### **Activate Asynchronous Support**

1. **Add the `@EnableAsync` Annotation:** Place this annotation in a Spring configuration class to activate asynchronous processing.
 
    ```java
    @Configuration
    @EnableAsync
    public class AsyncConfig {
        // Additional configurations if necessary
    }
    ```

2. **Verify Dependencies:** Ensure your Spring Boot project includes the necessary dependencies, such as `spring-boot-starter`, which implicitly supports asynchronous processing.

---

### **2. Configuring Task Executors**

Spring Boot’s default `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` is suitable for basic use cases. However, production-grade systems require a robust configuration of task executors for optimal performance and resource management.

#### **Customizing Thread Pools**

1. **Define a Custom Task Executor:** Use `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` to tailor thread pool settings according to your application’s requirements.
    ```java
    @Configuration
    public class AsyncConfig {
    
        @Bean(name = "taskExecutor")
        public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
            ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
            executor.setCorePoolSize(10);
            executor.setMaxPoolSize(20);
            executor.setQueueCapacity(50);
            executor.setThreadNamePrefix("CustomExecutor-");
            executor.initialize();
            return executor;
        }
    }
    ```
    **Parameter Explanations:**
    - `CorePoolSize`: Number of threads maintained in the pool at all times.
    - `MaxPoolSize`: Maximum allowable threads in the pool.
    - `QueueCapacity`: Queue length for holding tasks before they are executed.
    - `ThreadNamePrefix`: Prefix added to thread names for identification.
2. **Reference the Custom Executor:** Specify the executor name in the `@Async` annotation when multiple executors are configured.
    ```java
    @Async("taskExecutor")
    public void executeTask() {
        // Business logic
    }
    ```

---

### **3. Tuning Configuration for Performance**

Effective tuning of the thread pool enhances system performance and reliability. Consider the following best practices:

- **Calibrate Pool Sizes:**
    
    - Align `CorePoolSize` and `MaxPoolSize` with application concurrency demands.
    - Regularly monitor and adjust settings based on production workload metrics.
- **Manage Task Rejections:**
    
    - Use a `RejectedExecutionHandler` to define fallback mechanisms for tasks that exceed queue capacity.
    
    ```java
    executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
    ```
    
- **Integrate Monitoring Tools:**
    
    - Employ tools like Prometheus, Micrometer, or Spring Boot Actuator to track thread pool health and task execution statistics.
    - Set alerts for metrics such as queue saturation or thread pool exhaustion.

---

### **4. Asynchronous Configuration in `application.properties` or `application.yml`**

For simpler configurations, Spring Boot allows task executor settings to be managed through externalized configuration files:

**Example (`application.yml`):**

```yaml
spring:
  task:
    execution:
      pool:
        core-size: 10
        max-size: 20
        queue-capacity: 50
      thread-name-prefix: "CustomExecutor-"
```

This declarative approach ensures consistency across environments and simplifies debugging.

---

### **5. Validating and Testing Asynchronous Configuration**

To ensure proper functioning of the asynchronous setup, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Asynchronous Service:**
    
    ```java
    @Service
    public class AsyncService {
    
        @Async
        public void performTask() {
            System.out.println("Executing task on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
    ```
    
2. **Invoke the Asynchronous Method:**
    
    ```java
    @RestController
    public class AsyncController {
    
        @Autowired
        private AsyncService asyncService;
    
        @GetMapping("/run-task")
        public String runTask() {
            asyncService.performTask();
            return "Task execution initiated.";
        }
    }
    ```
    
3. **Verify Thread Execution:** Confirm that tasks run on threads prefixed with `CustomExecutor-`, demonstrating the use of the custom executor.
    

---

### **6. Advanced Considerations**

#### **Error Handling**

- Use `@Async` in conjunction with `@ExceptionHandler` or custom error-handling strategies to manage exceptions effectively.
- Spring’s `AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler` can handle exceptions thrown from `@Async` methods without `Future`.

#### **Chaining Asynchronous Tasks**

- Combine `CompletableFuture` with `@Async` for task chaining and coordination. For example, consider making two sequential API calls where the result of the first call feeds into the second:

```java
@Async
public CompletableFuture<String> fetchDataFromServiceA() {
    // Simulate fetching data from Service A
    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Data from Service A");
}

@Async
public CompletableFuture<String> fetchDataFromServiceB(String input) {
    // Simulate fetching data from Service B based on input
    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Processed " + input);
}

public void executeChainedTasks() {
    fetchDataFromServiceA()
        .thenCompose(this::fetchDataFromServiceB)
        .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Final Result: " + result));
}
```

```java
@Async
public CompletableFuture<String> asyncTask() {
    return CompletableFuture.completedFuture("Task Complete");
}
```


### Using the Custom TaskExecutor

By defining this custom TaskExecutor bean, Spring Boot will use it for any method annotated with @Async. Here’s how the asynchronous processing will work:

1. When a method annotated with @Async is called, Spring looks for a bean of type TaskExecutor.
2. If a TaskExecutor bean named taskExecutor is found, it will be used to run the method in a separate thread.
3. The ThreadPoolTaskExecutor ensures that the asynchronous tasks are executed according to the configured thread pool settings.

### Benefits of Custom TaskExecutor

Using a custom TaskExecutor offers several benefits:

- **Controlled Concurrency**: You can manage the number of concurrent threads, preventing resource exhaustion.
- **Queue Management**: By setting the queue capacity, you can handle a large number of tasks without overwhelming the system.
- **Thread Naming**: Custom thread names can simplify debugging and monitoring.
- **Scalability**: Proper configuration allows your application to handle varying loads efficiently.

By tuning these parameters based on your application’s requirements, you can optimize the performance and resource utilization of your Spring Boot application.

Calculating the ideal number for corePoolSize, maxPoolSize, and queueCapacity in a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor involves understanding the workload characteristics of your application, including task duration, task arrival rate, and system resources. Here are steps and considerations for calculating these values:

### 1. Understand Your Workload

- **Task Duration**: How long does each task typically take to execute? Measure or estimate the average and peak durations.
- **Task Arrival Rate**: How frequently do new tasks arrive? Measure the average and peak rates at which tasks are submitted.
- **Task Nature**: Are the tasks CPU-bound, I/O-bound, or a mix of both? CPU-bound tasks benefit more from parallel execution than I/O-bound tasks.

### 2. System Resources

- **CPU Cores**: How many CPU cores are available? For CPU-bound tasks, you don't want to exceed the number of cores significantly.
- **Memory**: How much memory does each task consume? Ensure that increasing the queue capacity and thread pool size does not exhaust system memory.

### 3. Calculating Core Pool Size (corePoolSize)

For CPU-bound tasks:

- A good starting point is to set corePoolSize to the number of available CPU cores. This ensures that each task has its own core and minimizes context switching.
- Formula: corePoolSize = Number of CPU cores

For I/O-bound or mixed tasks:

- Since I/O-bound tasks spend time waiting, you can have more threads than CPU cores.
- Estimate the ratio of waiting time to processing time (WT/PT).
- Formula: corePoolSize = Number of CPU cores * (1 + WT/PT)

### 4. Calculating Maximum Pool Size (maxPoolSize)

- maxPoolSize should accommodate peak loads. This can be higher than corePoolSize, but going too high may lead to resource exhaustion.
- If you expect occasional bursts of tasks, set maxPoolSize to a higher value to handle spikes.
- Formula: maxPoolSize = corePoolSize * 2 (as a starting point, adjust based on monitoring)

### 5. Calculating Queue Capacity (queueCapacity)

- Queue capacity determines how many tasks can wait when all core threads are busy.
- High queue capacity allows for handling large bursts of tasks without rejection but increases memory usage.
- Low queue capacity may lead to task rejections under heavy load but keeps memory usage lower.

Considerations:

- If tasks are short and arrive quickly, a larger queue might be necessary.
- If tasks are long-running, a smaller queue may be sufficient.

### Example Calculation

Suppose you have a system with 8 CPU cores, and tasks are a mix of CPU-bound and I/O-bound with a waiting time to processing time ratio of 3:1 (WT/PT = 3).

**Core Pool Size Calculation**:

- corePoolSize = Number of CPU cores * (1 + WT/PT)
- corePoolSize = 8 * (1 + 3)
- corePoolSize = 8 * 4 = 32

**Max Pool Size Calculation:**

- A starting point might be double the core pool size, depending on your system's capacity.
- maxPoolSize = corePoolSize * 2
- maxPoolSize = 32 * 2 = 64

**Queue Capacity Calculation:**

- If tasks are expected to arrive in bursts and you want to handle up to 5000 waiting tasks:
- Ensure the system has enough memory to handle this queue size.

 @Bean(name = "taskExecutor")
    public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(32);  // Adjust based on your calculation
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(64);   // Adjust based on your calculation
        executor.setQueueCapacity(5000);  // Adjust based on your needs and system capacity
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix("Async-");
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }

### Monitoring and Tuning

After deploying your application, monitor the following metrics:

- **Thread Pool Usage**: Ensure threads are not idle when there are tasks to be processed.
- **Queue Length**: Ensure tasks are not spending too much time in the queue.
- **System Resources**: Monitor CPU and memory usage to avoid resource exhaustion.
- **Task Execution Time**: Ensure tasks are completing in a reasonable time.

Based on these metrics, adjust corePoolSize, maxPoolSize, and queueCapacity to optimize performance and resource utilization.

By carefully analyzing and adjusting these parameters, you can find the ideal configuration that balances performance, resource usage, and responsiveness for your specific workload and system environment.
