When using these open-source models, keep in mind that you may need to customize and extend them to meet your specific requirements. Additionally, integrating a music recognition system involves more than just the model itself â€“ you'll need to handle audio input, preprocessing, and possibly integration with external APIs or databases for music metadata.
