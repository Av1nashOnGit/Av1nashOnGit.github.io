how can i erase sandisk pendrive on mac

ChatGPT

You can erase a SanDisk pen drive on a Mac using the built-in Disk Utility application. Here are the steps to do so:

**Caution**: Erasing a drive will delete all the data on it, so make sure you have a backup of any important data before proceeding.

1. **Insert the SanDisk pen drive** into an available USB port on your Mac.
    
2. **Open Disk Utility**. You can do this by either searching for "Disk Utility" using Spotlight (Cmd + Space and then type "Disk Utility") or by navigating to "Applications" > "Utilities" > "Disk Utility."
    
3. In the left sidebar of Disk Utility, **select your SanDisk pen drive**. It will be listed under the external devices section. Make sure you select the correct drive, as erasing will remove all data from the selected drive.
    
4. After selecting the pen drive, click the **"Erase"** button in the toolbar at the top of the Disk Utility window.
    
5. In the Erase dialog box, you can **choose a new name** for the pen drive if you wish (this is optional).
    
6. Next, you need to **select a format**. If you plan to use the pen drive with both Mac and Windows computers, it's recommended to choose **"ExFAT"** as the format since it's compatible with both platforms. If you're using it exclusively with Mac computers, you can choose **"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)"** or **"APFS"** if your Mac is running macOS 10.13 or later.
    
7. For **Scheme**, if you're erasing the entire drive, you can select **"GUID Partition Map"** if it's not already selected. This is the standard for modern Macs.
    
8. Double-check your selections to ensure you've chosen the correct drive, format, and scheme.
    
9. Once you're ready to proceed, click the **"Erase"** button in the Erase dialog box.
    
10. Disk Utility will display a confirmation prompt warning you that erasing the disk will delete all data on it. If you're sure, click **"Erase"** to start the process.
    

Disk Utility will then format and erase the SanDisk pen drive according to your specifications. Once the process is complete, the pen drive will be empty and ready to use.

i'm getting this error Erasing “disk5s2” and creating “sandisk64” Performing seven-pass secure erase… A writable disk is required. : (-69772) Operation failed…

ChatGPT

The error message you're encountering, "A writable disk is required. : (-69772)," suggests that the Mac is unable to perform a secure erase on the SanDisk pen drive because it's currently write-protected or read-only. This could be due to various reasons, including a physical write-protect switch on the pen drive (if it has one), or the pen drive itself might be malfunctioning.

Here are some steps to try and resolve the issue:

1. **Check for a Write-Protect Switch**: Some SanDisk pen drives come with a physical switch that allows you to write-protect the drive. If your pen drive has this switch, ensure that it's not in the write-protect position.
    
2. **Try a Different USB Port**: Occasionally, USB ports can have issues. Try plugging the pen drive into a different USB port on your Mac.
    
3. **Check for Physical Damage**: Examine the pen drive for physical damage. If there is any damage to the USB connector or the drive itself, it might be causing the issue.
    
4. **Use a Different Computer**: Try plugging the pen drive into another computer, preferably a Windows PC, to see if you can format it there. Sometimes, Mac-specific issues can be resolved this way.
    
5. **Remove Write Protection (Advanced)**: If you are comfortable with command-line operations, you can try to remove the write protection using the Terminal. Please be cautious when using Terminal commands as they can potentially erase data. Here are the steps:
    
    a. Open Terminal (you can find it in "Applications" > "Utilities").
    
    b. Use the following command to list all your disks:
    
    Copy code
    
    `diskutil list`
    
    c. Identify your SanDisk pen drive in the list (it will have a format like `/dev/diskX`).
    
    d. Use the following command to remove the write protection (replace `/dev/diskX` with the appropriate identifier for your pen drive):
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX`
    
    e. Try to format the pen drive again using Disk Utility.
    

If none of these steps work, it's possible that your pen drive is malfunctioning, and in that case, you might need to consider replacing it.

how can i remove write protection with cmd in mac

ChatGPT

To remove write protection from a USB drive using the command line (Terminal) on a Mac, you can use the `diskutil` command. This command will unmount the drive and change its settings to make it writable. Please be cautious when using Terminal commands, as they can potentially erase data or make irreversible changes to your storage devices.

Here are the steps to remove write protection from a USB drive:

1. **Open Terminal:** You can find Terminal in the "Applications" folder within the "Utilities" subfolder.
    
2. **List Available Disks:** Type the following command to list all the available disks and identify your USB drive:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `diskutil list`
    
    This command will display a list of all connected disks. Look for your USB drive in the list. It will likely be labeled something like `/dev/diskX` (where "X" is a number).
    
3. **Unmount the USB Drive:** To unmount the USB drive, use the following command (replace `/dev/diskX` with the identifier of your USB drive):
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX`
    
    You will be prompted to enter your Mac's password since this command requires administrative privileges.
    
4. **Remove Write Protection:** Now, you can attempt to remove the write protection. Run the following command (replace `/dev/diskX` with your USB drive's identifier):
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `sudo diskutil eraseDisk FreeName none /dev/diskX`
    
    This command will erase the drive with no name and remove any write protection that was in place.
    
5. **Verify the Removal:** After running the above command, check to see if the write protection has been removed by trying to write some data to the USB drive. You should be able to copy files to it without any issues.
    

If this process doesn't work or if your USB drive continues to exhibit write protection problems, it's possible that the drive itself is physically damaged or has a malfunction. In such cases, you may need to consider replacing the USB drive.
