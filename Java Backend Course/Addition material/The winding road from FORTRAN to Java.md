In the mid-1950s, a team of people created a programming language named **FORTRAN**. It was a good language for its time, but it followed the traditional approach of issuing direct, imperative commands to the computer. For example:
```
PRINT "Hello, World!"
```

In the years that followed, several new computer languages emerged, many of which continued the "Do this/Do that" model introduced by FORTRAN. One such popular language was **C**, which became widely used for its simplicity and efficiency. The "Do this/Do that" paradigm persisted in the programming world.

However, some language designers realized that there could be a better way to approach programming. Languages like **SIMULA** and **Smalltalk** shifted the focus from issuing commands to describing data and its behavior. Instead of explicitly commanding the computer to print a list of delinquent accounts, they would define what an "account" means, including its attributes and methods for checking delinquency. This approach emphasized the importance of data, leading to the birth of **object-oriented programming languages**.

## Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming offers several advantages, including:

1. **Improved Problem Solving**: Thinking first about the data and its interactions helps create better-designed solutions to problems.
2. **Reusability**: Descriptions of data (classes) can be reused throughout the program or even in different projects, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
3. **Flexibility**: Object-oriented programs are more adaptable to changes because they are based on objects with well-defined interfaces.
4. **Encapsulation**: Data and methods that operate on the data are encapsulated within objects, making it easier to manage and understand the code.
5. **Modularity**: Programs can be broken down into smaller, manageable modules (objects), making development and maintenance more manageable.

## Enter C++

In 1986, **Bjarne Stroustrup** introduced **C++**, a language that combined the familiar C language with object-oriented features. It became very popular because it allowed programmers to use the C programming style and also adopt object-oriented principles if desired. However, this dual nature of C++ also led to confusion. Some programmers would still resort to the procedural "Do this/Do that" approach, defeating the purpose of having an object-oriented language.

## The Birth of Java

In 1995, **James Gosling** of Sun Microsystems set out to create a language that embraced object-oriented principles wholeheartedly. The result was **Java**. Java retained the look and feel of C++ but discarded most of the procedural features. Gosling focused on making object-oriented development smoother and more intuitive.

With Java, everything revolves around objects. Every program starts with a class containing a `main` method, which serves as the entry point. Here's a basic example:
```
public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    } 
}
```
In Java, you don't have a choice to bypass object-oriented features. Working with objects is an inherent part of the language's design philosophy. This design decision ensures cleaner, more maintainable, and extensible codebases.

## Conclusion

From the early days of FORTRAN and the imperative "Do this/Do that" style, the evolution of programming languages has brought us to Java, a language that emphasizes the importance of objects and data in software development. Embracing object-oriented programming in Java not only improves problem-solving skills but also promotes code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability - characteristics essential for modern programming practices.
