# Java Collections and Data Structures Course

## Introduction to Data Structures

- Understanding the role of data structures in programming.
- Importance of selecting appropriate data structures for different scenarios.
- Common types of data structures: arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

## Arrays and Lists

- Introduction to arrays and their characteristics.
- Declaring and initializing arrays in Java.
- Working with one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
- Introduction to ArrayList and LinkedList.
- Adding, accessing, modifying, and removing elements in ArrayList and LinkedList.
- Performance comparison between arrays and lists.

## Stacks and Queues

- Concept of stacks and their LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior.
- Implementing stacks using Java's Stack class.
- Applications of stacks: expression evaluation, function calls, etc.
- Introduction to queues and their FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior.
- Implementing queues using Java's LinkedList.
- Applications of queues: task scheduling, breadth-first search, etc.

## Hashing and HashMap

- Understanding hashing and its importance in data retrieval.
- Hash functions and collision resolution techniques.
- Introduction to HashMap: key-value pairs and associative arrays.
- Adding, retrieving, updating, and removing elements in HashMap.
- Hashing performance and time complexity analysis.

## Set and HashSet

- Introduction to Set interface: storing unique elements.
- HashSet implementation: hashing and internal storage.
- Adding, retrieving, and removing elements from HashSet.
- Working with TreeSet: ordered set implementation.
- Use cases and scenarios for using sets.

## Tree Data Structures

- Introduction to trees and their hierarchical structure.
- Binary Trees: understanding binary nodes and their properties.
- Binary Search Trees (BST): maintaining sorted data.
- Operations on BST: insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.
- Balancing BST: AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees.

## Graph Data Structures

- Basics of graph theory: vertices and edges.
- Directed and undirected graphs.
- Graph representation: adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
- Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.
- Applications of graphs: social networks, network routing, etc.

## Sorting and Searching Algorithms

- Importance of sorting and searching algorithms.
- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort: concepts and implementation.
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort: divide and conquer strategies.
- Linear Search and Binary Search: comparison-based searching.

## Complexity Analysis

- Introduction to time complexity and Big O notation.
- Analyzing time complexity of common algorithms.
- Best case, worst case, and average case scenarios.
- Understanding space complexity and its analysis.

## Final Projects

- Implementing real-world scenarios using data structures and algorithms.
- Applying learned concepts to solve practical programming problems.
- Developing efficient and optimized solutions.
