## Task 1: Array Basics

1. **Task**: Create an array of integers with 5 elements. Initialise the array with values of your choice. Calculate and print the sum of all elements in the array.
    
2. **Task**: Create an array of strings with 7 elements. Initialise the array with names of days of the week. Print the names of the days in reverse order.
    
3. **Task**: Create an array of doubles with 10 elements. Initialise the array with random decimal values between 0 and 1. Find and print the average of all the values in the array.

  0.  0.1,0.1001,0.2,0.3,1


## Task 2: Searching and Sorting

1. **Task**: Create an array of integers. find a specific integer in the array. Print whether the element is found or not.
    
2. **Task**: Create an array of strings containing names. find a specific name in the sorted array. Print whether the name is found or not.
    
3. **Task**: Create an array of integers. sort the elements in ascending order. Print the sorted array.

## Task 3: Manipulating Arrays

1. **Task**: Create an array of integers. Reverse the order of elements in the array without using any additional arrays. Print the reversed array.
    
2. **Task**: Create two arrays of integers with equal lengths. Implement array element-wise addition and store the result in a new array. Print the resulting array.
  arr1 = {9,2,3,8}  
  arr2 = {1,2,3,4}  
  sum ={1,0,4,7,2} = N+1
    
3. **Task**: Create an array of characters. Implement a function that counts and prints the frequency of each character in the array.


## Challenge Task:

**Task**: Given an array of integers, find and print the two elements that have the maximum difference among all pairs of elements in the array.

**Hint**: Iterate through the array, and for each element, find the difference with every other element and keep track of the maximum difference.
